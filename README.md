Experiment 3

Aim:
To study and implement Operators in C++.

Theory:
In C++, operators are special symbols that perform operations on operands. They are categorized into various types based on their functionality:

Arithmetic Operators: Used to perform mathematical operations.

• + → Addition

• - → Subtraction

• * → Multiplication

• / → Division

• % → Modulus

• ++ → Increment

• -- → Decrement

Relational Operators: Used to compare two values.
• == → Equal to (this compares if the two are equal to each other and does not assign)

• != → Not equal to

• > → Greater than

• < → Less than

• >= → Greater than or equal to

• <= → Less than or equal to

Logical Operators: Used to combine conditional statements.
• && → Logical AND

• || → Logical OR

• ! → Logical NOT

Assignment Operators: Used to assign values to variables.

• = → Assignment

• += → Add and assign

• -= → Subtract and assign

• *= → Multiply and assign

• /= → Divide and assign

• %= → Modulus and assign

CONCLUSION- we learnt how to use operators in C++.
